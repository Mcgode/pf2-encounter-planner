# pf2-encounter-planner
A Pathfinder 2nd Edition encounter planner

Use the tool : https://mcgode.github.io/pf2-encounter-planner

The tool has now entered its beta phase. It's functional, 
but some features might be missing. And you might find some bugs. 

## About this tool

This tool was inspired by a spreadsheet by Dalvyn 
([original sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/147Qwk0-nl1tvDNCyYBzXXskMAaU4MQJ53RYa4qVEIbI/edit?usp=sharing), in French).
That spreadsheet had a few issues and shortcomings that were not easy to 
solve by just making a better spreadsheet. As a consequence, I decided to 
make an upgraded version using a web app, hosted on Github Pages.
