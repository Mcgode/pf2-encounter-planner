            <div>
                PF2 Encounter Planner is an open-source tool aimed primarily at Pathfinder 2nd edition Dungeon
                Masters. <br>
                Its main goal is to assist the DM in his encounter planning task by providing him the tools for building
                encounters, be them composed of fights, hazards, or even simply dialog encounters that might reward the
                players for their cunning and actions. <br>
                The tool also provides encounter history feature, which allows the DM to set up an event timeline, to
                calculate the experience of his players. <br>
                <br>
                So let's <a href="/" target="_blank">launch to tool</a>, shall we? <br>
                Upon opening this tool for the first time, you will have an example session opened for you. So first of
                all what is a session ? <br>
                A session is meant to represent an adventure, or a collection of smaller, related adventures (this is up
                to you to decide). Each session is independent from one another, so you can have different rules and
                players, specific to each one. As such, the tool only keeps one of them open at a time. <br>
                <br>
                The tool itself is divided in three main tabs :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="#encounter-planner">encounter planner</a> tab, where you can create named encounters and defines its elements. You
                        will most likely use this tab before your game sessions, during the DM preparation phase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="#encounter-history">encounter history</a> tab, where you will be able to set up a
                        timeline of the events that unfolded during your game(s). It will help you in counting the xp
                        rewards for your players.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="#session-settings">session settings</a> tab, where you'll be able to configure
                        parameters for the session, like under-leveled player xp multipliers and the like. This is also
                        where you can declare the players involved in this session.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    Every time you make a change to the session or its content, that change will be saved to your browser
                    local storage, allowing you to reload the tool later and still keep its content
                </div>

                Finally, you also have a top bar for special actions like opening another session or creating a new one.
            </div>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="encounter-planner">Encounter planner</h2>

            <div>
                As the name suggests, the encounter planner will be your go-to tab for planning out your encounters in a
                given session.

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 id="encounters">Encounters</h4>

                    <div>
                        Encounters are meant to scale from a simple fight, conversation or the like, up to a
                        fully-fledged part of your adventure. Basically, it is a set of milestone elements for a
                        specific part of your adventure. <br>
                        Those encounters have unique names and can be created, renamed, moved and deleted as you see
                        fit. <br>
                        <br>
                        Selecting an encounter will toggle the collapse of its inner content. A quick demonstration :

                        <div class="accordion" id="encounters-accordion-demonstration" style="margin-top: 1em">

                    <div>
                        Encounter elements are events included in your encounters that include XP rewards. They appear
                        in four different forms:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Fight elements</strong>: An element representing a specific fight during the
                                adventure. More info in the <a href="#how-to-build-a-fight">How to build a fight</a>
                                section
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Accomplishment elements</strong>: Represents a minor, moderate or major
                                accomplishment with XP values from the core rulebook (10, 30 or 80 xp).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Hazard elements</strong>: Use this when your players will be facing a set of
                                hazards. More info in the <a href="#how-to-build-hazards">How to build hazards</a>
                                section
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Custom elements</strong>: Elements that don't belong in any other category, and
                                give out a flat XP reward
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Those elements are named, and there are no name restriction (you can have multiple elements with
                        the same name for instance), can be modified by clicking on them, moved within the encounter
                        with some drag and dropping, or even deleted as you see fit. <br>
                        <div class="alert alert-info" style="margin-top: 1em">
                            The displayed name will appear with additional information of the element, like the XP
                            reward. This provides a preview of the element to provide user with a quicker access to
                            the element's key information
                        </div>

                        Those elements will be used later when setting up an event timeline, in the encounter history.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 id="how-to-build-a-fight">How to build a fight</h4>

                    <div>
                        A fight is an encounter element involving the players (and optionally some NPCs) fending off
                        creatures. <br>
                        Given the nature of the element, it can only provide an expected XP reward, given that the
                        reward can be influenced by the number of players (and NPC allies) and the level of their group.

                        <div class="alert alert-warning" style="margin-top: 1em">
                            Note that, as of now, the tool only takes the group level, and not the individual levels,
                            into account for calculating the XP reward for a given creature, given that it is how the
                            core rulebooks expects DMs to handle XP rewards for combat. <br>
                            However this tool provides options like group level function selection to adapt to your
                            preferences if it comes to this. <br>
                            Note also that the tool also handles the XP of players individually, it just grants the same
                            base XP to all of the participants of the fight and as such needs to use a group level.
                        </div>

                        <br>
                        Once it is done, you need to set up the enemies involved in this fight. For each creature you
                        need to set:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Name (optional): The name of the creature
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Level: The level of the creature
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Amount: The amount of instances of this creature in the fight
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Link (optional): The name of the creature
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        During this entire process, the tool will give you a preview of the XP rewards for each
                        individual creature, and the entire fight, based off the data you provided earlier. It will
                        give the fight a rating, going from 'Trivial' to 'Extreme', with an additional
                        'Impossible' rating

                        <div class="alert alert-warning" style="margin-top: 1em">
                            Remember that the 'Extreme' rating is meant to be the highest rating, according to the core
                            rulebook. If you still want to have an 'Impossible' rating, remember to allow impossible
                            encounters in the session settings
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 id="how-to-build-hazards">How to build hazards</h4>

                    <div>
                        Hazards are handled in a similar manner to fights, with two differences: the group count does
                        not influence the XP reward, and an individual can be a simple hazard, or a complex one.
