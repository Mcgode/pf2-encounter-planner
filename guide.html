                PF2 Encounter Planner is an open-source tool aimed primarily at Pathfinder 2nd edition Dungeon
                Masters. <br>
                Its main goal is to assist the DM in his encounter planning task by providing him the tools for building
                encounters, be them composed of fights, hazards, or even simply dialog encounters that might reward the
                players for their cunning and actions. <br>
                The tool also provides encounter history feature, which allows the DM to set up an event timeline, to
                calculate the experience of his players. <br>
                <br>
                So let's <a href="/" target="_blank">launch to tool</a>, shall we? <br>
                Upon opening this tool for the first time, you will have an example session opened for you. So first of
                all what is a session ? <br>
                A session is meant to represent an adventure, or a collection of smaller, related adventures (this is up
                to you to decide). Each session is independent from one another, so you can have different rules and
                players, specific to each one. As such, the tool only keeps one of them open at a time. <br>
                <br>
                The tool itself is divided in three main tabs :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="#encounter-planner">encounter planner</a> tab, where you can create named encounters and defines its elements. You
                        will most likely use this tab before your game sessions, during the DM preparation phase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="#encounter-history">encounter history</a> tab, where you will be able to set up a
                        timeline of the events that unfolded during your game(s). It will help you in counting the xp
                        rewards for your players.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="#session-settings">session settings</a> tab, where you'll be able to configure
                        parameters for the session, like under-leveled player xp multipliers and the like. This is also
                        where you can declare the players involved in this session.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    Every time you make a change to the session or its content, that change will be saved to your browser
                    local storage, allowing you to reload the tool later and still keep its content
                </div>

                Finally, you also have a top bar for special actions like opening another session or creating a new one.
